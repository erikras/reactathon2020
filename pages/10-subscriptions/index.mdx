# Exercise 10 – Optimization Through Subscriptions

Minimize rerenders of each `<Field/>` and the entire `<Form/>` in `pages/10-subscriptions/SignUpForm.js`. A `<RenderCount/>` component has been included to help you visualize how each component is being rerendered.

This page will hot-reload with your changes.

<SignupForm />

## Description

The thing that sets React Final Form apart from all other form libraries is the ability to finely tune precisely when your components will be rerendered. This is done via "subscriptions", by allowing you to specify exactly which bits of field or form state you want your component to be notified about.

## `subscription` Prop

Both `<Form/>` and `<Field/>` accept a `subscription` prop, which is an object full of booleans. You can think of it like a MongoDB projection or a GraphQL query, where you specify exactly which bits of state you care about. For example, if you only wanted to know when your form becomes dirty, you could do something like this:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
<Form onSubmit={onSubmit} subscription={{ dirty: true }}>
  {({ handleSubmit, dirty }) => (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>

      <div>{dirty ? 'Form is dirty' : 'Form is pristine'}</div>
    
      ...fields here...

    </form>
  )}
</Form>
```

By default, if no `subscription` prop is passed, your `<Form/>` or `<Field/>` will be notified of _all state changes_. **This is a reasonable default.**

## `<FormSpy/>` component

Up until this point we have ignored the third component provided by the React Final Form API: [`<FormSpy/>`](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/api/FormSpy). That is because you have no need for it _until_ you are using subscriptions. What does `<FormSpy/>` do?

`<FormSpy/>` allows you to inject form state that you are not subscribed to in the surrounding `<Form/>` component.

From [the docs](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/api/FormSpy):

> [`<FormSpy/>` is] a component that subscribes to form state, and injects both form state and the form instance via a render prop.
>
> The `<FormSpy/>` will rerender any time the form state it is subscribed to changes. By default it subscribes to all form state. You can control which form state it subscribes to with the `subscription` prop.

When is it useful? Well, what if our form in the example above was _huge_, and we didn't want to rerender the whole thing every time our `dirty` flag changed? This is an extremely contrived example, but we could do something like this:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
<Form onSubmit={onSubmit} subscription={{}}>
  {({ handleSubmit }) => (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>

      <FormSpy subscription={{ dirty: true }}>
        {({ dirty }) => (
          <div>{dirty ? 'Form is dirty' : 'Form is pristine'}</div>
        )}
      </FormSpy>

      ...fields here... 
      
      This part of the form will not be rerendered when `dirty` changes.
    </form>
  )}
</Form>
```

Notice that we have set our form-wide subscription to `{}` (nothing), and have wrapped our "dirty div" with a `<FormSpy/>` subscribed to `dirty`.

As always, when discussing optimization, it must be said:

### ⚠️ DO NOT OPTIMIZE YOUR FORM UNTIL YOU HAVE PERFORMANCE ISSUES ⚠️
