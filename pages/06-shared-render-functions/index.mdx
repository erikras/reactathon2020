# Exercise 6 – Shared Render Functions

Refactor `pages/06-shared-render-functions/SignupForm.js` to use a single render function, passing through `placeHolder` to the `<input/>` and `<label/>` components in `SignupForm.js`, and use this opportunity to highlight the entire `<div/>` with a `className="active"` when the field it contains has focus (hint: when `meta.active` is `true`).

This page will hot-reload with your changes.

<SignupForm />

## Description

Programmers hate repeated code. Right now if you had to change the `className` on your errors, you'd have to change a `<span>` for every field.

Each field should look something like:

```jsx
<Field
  name="firstName"
  validate={required}
  render={renderInput}
  placeholder="First Name"
/>
```

## `<Field/>` passes along additional props

One feature of `<Field/>` is that it will pass along any additional props that you give it – _that are not part of [its API](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/types/FieldProps)_ – to your render function or component. This allows for some creative code reuse.

```jsx
<Field name="myField" meaningOfLife={42}>
  {({ input, meta, meaningOfLife }) => {
    console.log(meaningOfLife) // 42
    return <input {...input} />
  }}
</Field>
```
